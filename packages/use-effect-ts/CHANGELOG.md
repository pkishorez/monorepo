# use-effect-ts

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- [`3e4f58d`](https://github.com/pkishorez/monorepo/commit/3e4f58d500e3060b5a027f2a370e6ff0de233a5e) Thanks [@pkishorez](https://github.com/pkishorez)! - Pin the `effect` peer dependency (and other registry peers) to exact versions. The previous `^4.0.0-beta.102` range also matched `4.0.0-rc.*` prereleases, so fresh installs (e.g. `npx laymos`) resolved an incompatible `effect` build and crashed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- [`f055c4e`](https://github.com/pkishorez/monorepo/commit/f055c4ea6ab9fe0d8f75bfba013a0febbdd4cbe4) Thanks [@pkishorez](https://github.com/pkishorez)! - Widen the peer ranges to `effect@^4.0.0-beta.102` and `react@^19.2.7`. `effect`
  was pinned to the exact `4.0.0-beta.78`, which forced a duplicate install for
  anyone already on a later beta. No runtime code changed.
