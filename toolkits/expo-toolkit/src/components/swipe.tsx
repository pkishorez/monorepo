/**
 * Swipe — a row that slides aside to reveal the things you can do to it.
 *
 * It is the one list interaction a phone has that a page does not: the actions
 * are not on screen taking up room, they are behind the row, and the gesture
 * that reveals them is the same one everywhere else in the OS. An inbox, a
 * task list, a settings screen — all of them want it, and all of them
 * otherwise end up with a trailing button too small to hit.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Swipe>
 *   <Swipe.End>
 *     <Swipe.Action icon={<TrashIcon />} label="Delete" color="destructive" onPress={remove} />
 *   </Swipe.End>
 *   <Item variant="outline">
 *     <Item.Content><Item.Title>Invoice.pdf</Item.Title></Item.Content>
 *   </Item>
 * </Swipe>
 * ```
 *
 * The sides are `start` and `end` rather than left and right, because the
 * gesture mirrors with the reading direction: in a right-to-left app the row
 * that opened toward the right has to open toward the left, and a caller
 * should not have to write that twice. Yoga mirrors where the panels sit; the
 * drag is measured in raw pixels and cannot be mirrored for us, so it reads
 * the direction and turns itself around.
 *
 * Everything that moves runs on the UI thread. A row being dragged does not
 * re-render — the only React work in a swipe is the callback at the end of it.
 *
 * Rows in a `Swipe.Group` close each other, so only one of them is ever open.
 * That is the behaviour of every list on the phone that has this gesture, and
 * a row cannot arrange it alone: it knows when it opens and has no way to hear
 * that a sibling did.
