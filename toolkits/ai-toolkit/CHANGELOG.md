### Patch Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/pkishorez/monorepo/pull/59) [`a1cb02d`](https://github.com/pkishorez/monorepo/commit/a1cb02d062c76b0b5ae57f04b37746276f6426f1) Thanks [@kishorenuma](https://github.com/kishorenuma)! - Moves to stable Effect 4. The `effect` peer is now `^4.0.0`, so any Effect 4 release works, and Effect 4.0.0 is required: it drops the `effect/unstable/*` import paths these packages relied on.

  Other peer changes:

  - The optional `alchemy` peer is now `2.0.0-beta.80`, the first alchemy release that runs on Effect 4.0.0.
  - pwa-toolkit's optional `vite` peer is now `^8.0.0`. It was published as the Vite+ core alias by mistake.
  - std-toolkit's optional `vitest` peer, for `@kstackz/std-toolkit/snapshot/vitest`, is now `^5.0.0`.

- [#56](https://github.com/pkishorez/monorepo/pull/56) [`61d6861`](https://github.com/pkishorez/monorepo/commit/61d686171019c76b5f2fb350860697388e59513c) Thanks [@kishorenuma](https://github.com/kishorenuma)! - Initial release under the `@kstackz` scope.

  Runs Claude Code and Codex turns on a server and stores every thread, run, and message in a std-toolkit table. A client starts a run over RPC and follows it through the synced table, so long turns survive closed tabs and reconnects. You need it to put coding agents behind your app without tying each turn to one open connection.
