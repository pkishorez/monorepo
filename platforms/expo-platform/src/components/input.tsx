/**
 * Input — a text field with a label, a description and an error line.
 *
 * The field's focus state is animated rather than switched. A border that
 * snaps between two colours reads as a redraw; one that crosses over in
 * 150ms reads as the field responding to you. The interpolation runs on the
 * UI thread, so it costs nothing and keeps up with a fast tab through a form.
 *
 * Two backgrounds, because a field's job changes with what surrounds it:
 * `outline` sits on the page and draws its own edge; `filled` sits inside a
 * card or a sheet, where a second border next to the container's own reads as
 * a seam.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Input label="Email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
 * <Input variant="filled" size="lg" label="Name" isRequired />
 * <Input label="Note" startContent={<PencilIcon size={18} />} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## An icon inside the field, and why it lives here
 *
 * `startContent` and `endContent` are measured and turned into padding on the
 * text, so a value never runs underneath them however wide they turn out to
 * be. They are positioned against the *field box* rather than against the
 * component, which is the whole reason they are a prop rather than something
 * you compose: a label and a description are laid out above and below the
 * field, so anything centred on the component as a whole drifts upward the
 * moment a label is added.
 *
 * Both are pressable. A button dropped in there — a clear ✕, a show-password
 * eye — gets its own touches, while the padding around it stays transparent so
 * a tap that misses still lands on the field and puts the caret in it. An icon
 * that is only decoration should say so with `interactiveContent={false}`,
 * which gives the whole field back to the caret and takes the icon out of the
 * accessibility tree.
 *
 * `InputGroup` is still the right answer for a decorator that is not part of
 * the field — a button attached to its end, a select bolted to its start, an
 * addon with its own background. It measures the same way; it just spans a
 * different box.
