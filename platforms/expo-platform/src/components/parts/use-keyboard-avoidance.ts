/**
 * useKeyboardAvoidance — keep an element clear of the software keyboard.
 *
 * `KeyboardAvoidingView` shifts or pads an entire subtree by the full keyboard
 * height regardless of where the element actually sits, which over-scrolls
 * short forms and does nothing useful for an element already above the fold.
 * This works from the element's own position instead.
 *
 * Two modes, because "get out of the keyboard's way" and "ride the keyboard"
 * are different jobs:
 *
 * - **`lift`** (default) — for a field sitting in the page's flow. The element
 *   is measured every frame while the keyboard is up and moved by exactly the
 *   current overlap, so it follows the scroll: scroll it clear and the lift
 *   decays to nothing, scroll it back under and the lift returns. Measuring
 *   once and holding the result is what leaves a field hanging out of its own
 *   slot the moment the page moves underneath it.
 * - **`dock`** — for an absolutely-positioned composer, toolbar or search bar
 *   pinned near the bottom edge. There is nothing to measure: the element
 *   simply travels with the keyboard, less whatever bottom inset it is already
 *   sitting above.
 *
 * ## Install the keyboard controller
 *
 * ```sh
 * npx expo install react-native-keyboard-controller
 * ```
 *
 * It is an optional peer, but on Android it is close to required. Reanimated's
 * own `useAnimatedKeyboard` — the fallback used when the controller is absent —
 * is deprecated in Reanimated 4, and merely *calling* it switches Android out
 * of `adjustResize` into manual inset handling for the whole app. That is a
 * global side effect from a local hook, and it is why keyboard avoidance built
 * on it tends to work on iOS and break on Android.
 *
 * With the controller installed, wrap your app in its `KeyboardProvider` —
 * `PanelUIProvider` does this for you when the package is present.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const { ref, onLayout, animatedStyle } = useKeyboardAvoidance();
 *
 * <Animated.View ref={ref} onLayout={onLayout} style={animatedStyle}>
 *   <TextInput />
 * </Animated.View>
 * ```

   *   a dialog whose content unmounts on close takes the element with it while
   *   the keyboard is still on its way down.
   * - the worklet itself, whenever a measurement comes back null. That write
   *   belongs to the UI thread, so it lands whatever order the teardown
   *   arrives in, and a view that has gone costs one warning rather than one
   *   per frame.
   *
   * A disarm that was only a race is put back by the next layout pass, or by
