/**
 * KeyboardAvoider — a view that keeps itself clear of the keyboard.
 *
 * A thin wrapper over `useKeyboardAvoidance` for the common case of "keep this
 * box visible", so a form does not have to wire the ref, layout handler and
 * animated style by hand.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // In the flow of a scrolling page: lifts by the overlap, follows the scroll.
 * <KeyboardAvoider active={focused}>…</KeyboardAvoider>
 *
 * // Pinned to the bottom edge: rides the keyboard up and back down.
 * <KeyboardAvoider
 *   mode="dock"
 *   bottomInset={insets.bottom}
 *   className="absolute left-0 right-0"
 *   style={{ bottom: insets.bottom + 16 }}
 * >
 *   …
 * </KeyboardAvoider>
 * ```
